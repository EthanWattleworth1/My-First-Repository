My First Repository

This is a sample of a good README.md file that can be used when describing a project. You can change the headings to fit your needs, but the idea is to provide a summary of the project, the files used, programs written and how to execute the program. Think of this as documentation.
This is a test.
Lets see what happens.

Practice using GitHub by creating a sample repository. Make sure you add a description to help others understand your project. This should explain in detail what you did in this project, what you accomplished, outcomes, results, and so on.

This project helped me practice creating a repository, customizing a README.md file, and using Markdown syntax to improve documentation skills.
